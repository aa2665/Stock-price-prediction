The aim of the project is to examine a number of different forecasting techniques to predict 
future stock returns based on past returns and numerical news indicators to construct a 
portfolio of multiple stocks in order to diversify the risk. We do this by applying supervised 
learning methods for stock price forecasting by interpreting the seemingly chaotic market 
data. 

It would involve supervised classification methods like Support 
Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, Ensemble classifiers (like 
Adaboost, Random Forest Classifiers), etc. 

These models would be used to get the expected numerical value of the 
interested stocks.This phase would involve supervised regressions methods 
like Linear Regressions, Support Vector Regressions, Usage of Kernel Methods, 
etc.
